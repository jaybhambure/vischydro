# Script to run bjorken hydro tests with gaussian initial conditions
# The folllowing script can run either uniform or gaussian bjorken hydro
# tests. In the uniform case we are comparing the code result to the ODE
# solution. In the gaussian case we just run and plot the result.
#
# The usage is:
# python bjorkentests.py --testcase uniform
# or
# python bjorkentests.py --testcase gaussian
